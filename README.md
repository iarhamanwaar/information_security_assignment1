# Apology for Late Submission of Assignment

Dear Haroon Mehmood,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to sincerely apologize for the late submission of my assignment, which was due today (I only submitted it 1 hour late, you can check my commit time). I understand the importance of adhering to deadlines, and I take full responsibility for my delay in submitting the assignment.

The primary reason for my late submission is that I run a software company, and over the past few days, I have been inundated with **urgent tasks and responsibilities** related to my company's operations. These unexpected demands on my time left me with insufficient opportunity to complete the assignment within the stipulated timeframe.

I understand that this should not excuse my lateness, and I deeply regret any inconvenience this may have caused you.

I have put a lot of effort into this assignment and wanted to ensure it was of the highest quality. Despite the delay, I am committed to delivering my best work and would greatly appreciate the opportunity to have my assignment reviewed and considered for a grade.

I completely understand if there are any penalties for the late submission, and I am willing to accept them. However, if it is within your discretion, I kindly request that you accept my assignment and consider it for grading.

Running a software company has its challenges and demands, but I am taking measures to better manage my time and responsibilities to ensure that such delays do not occur in the future.

Once again, I am truly sorry for my tardiness and any disruption it may have caused. Thank you for your understanding and consideration.

Sincerely,
Sahibzada Arham Anwaar Bugvi
